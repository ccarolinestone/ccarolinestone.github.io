                <p> 
                    During certain times of the year, it is difficult to find specific food items in stores or restaurants. For example, it is challenging to find pumpkin bread outside of the fall season because many stores do not have it. Our solution will provide users a guide to locating their favorite consumables no matter the season.

                    Our team thought about the details and questions surrounding our seasonal food application. We were brainstorming ideas on the layout of the app and how we wanted to reach out to small businesses. Additionally, we thought about how the application could be used to share product information and recipes with friends.
